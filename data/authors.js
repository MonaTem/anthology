    'name': 'Doug Lipman',
    'bio': 'Decades ago, I was a very discouraged teacher of emotionally disturbed adolescents. I wanted to be on their side, but all they did was fold their arms and scowl. One day, by accident, I told them a story. They responded! For the duration of the story, we were on the same side! That experience gave me hope, so I renewed my efforts. Months later, we finally became the cooperative classroom I had dreamed of Ever since then, I have pursued the transformative power of storytelling. I pursue it for myself, and work hard to find ever more efficient and satisfying ways to help others master it, too.',
